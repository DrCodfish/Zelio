Zelo Coding Style Guide

Adhering to a consistent coding style is essential for readability and maintainability.

Code Formatting
- Use tabs for indentation. Do not use 4 spaces.
- Each function should be separated by exactly one line.
- Lines should be no longer than 80 characters.
- Braces should be on the same line as the statement (e.g., if (condition) {).

Variable Naming
- Use camelCase for variable names (e.g., myVariable).
- Use PascalCase for class or type names (e.g., MyClass).

Function Naming
- Use descriptive names for functions, e.g., parseInput(), compileCode().

Documentation
- Use the /activity/func_use directory for function descriptions and paramaters.
