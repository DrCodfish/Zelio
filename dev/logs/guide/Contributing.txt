How to Contribute to Zelo

1. Fork the Repository
Start by forking the repository to your own GitHub account. This will allow you to make changes without affecting the main project until your pull request is merged.

2. Create a Branch
Create a new branch for the feature or bugfix you're working on. We recommend naming branches based on the feature or issue, like "feature/awesome-feature" or "bugfix/fix-issue-123".

3. Make Changes and Test
Write code for your changes, following the coding style guidelines. Ensure your code is well-tested and follows best practices. Run the project on all platforms you intend to support, and ensure that no existing features break.

4. Submit a Pull Request (PR)
Once your changes are complete, submit a pull request to the "main" branch. Provide a detailed description of what you've done and why. You can reference the related issues and include any testing instructions.
